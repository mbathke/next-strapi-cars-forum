# next-strapi-cars-forum

Forum software based on next.js and strapi.js for car enthusiasts.

This software is in a very early stage of development. So the infomation about it is very rare here.
Just some quick notes on the technologies used in this software:

* The backend uses the [strapi](https://strapi.io/) headless cms.
* The frontend uses [next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
* For the styling it uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
* Furthermore the project is written in Typescript.
